In trios the team will do 112, it follows a snake-like pattern (1-2-3-3-2-1-1-2-3).
Again, the diagram below has all the instructions. 
When player 1 gets the staff for the 2nd time, and verzik is <45% hp, double spec and stay on verzik. Player 2 and 3 then also stay the boss and dump their specs. Do not do this if not everybody knows how to do this.
